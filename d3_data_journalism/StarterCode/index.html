          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Obesity</h2>
          <p>The Census Bureau determines poverty status by using an official poverty measure (OPM) that compares pre-tax cash income against a threshold that is set at three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 and adjusted for family size.The OPM uses calculations of these three elements—income, threshold, and family—to estimate what percentage of the population is poor.</p>

          <p>Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI), a person’s weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of his or her height (in metres). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. A person with a BMI equal to or more than 25 is considered overweight.</p>

          <p>In this graph, we are plotting Obesity rates in the US against Poverty rates. One can see that there is a positive relationship between the two variables. That is, if a state has a high poverty rate, it is likely to also have a high Obesity population</p>
